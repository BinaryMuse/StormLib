* Description:  implementation for StormLib - linux port
*       intended to be used in GLdiablo
*       
*   ---->   StormLib was originally developed for Windows by
*       Ladislav Zezula (www.zezula.net), and he did
*       a _great_ job! Thanks Ladislav!
*
*   this is currently a quick and dirty hack to get it working
*    don't expect beauty and/or miracles :)
*
*   these are function wraps to execute Windows API calls
*        as native Macintosh file calls (open/close/read/write/...)
*
*   continue you work: added some wrapping functions for GNU/Linux  by XPinguin
